HOW TO BECOME A MODDER / MAPPER
---
1) Submit a mod in the mods page. Your mod will be in the " New mods" List for a week. If the moderators/admins deem it to be a mod unique enough to join the ranks of the mods list, then you will become a modder. Same goes for map makers.

2) Spamming me with requests to become a modder will not work.
